## 📂 Project Overview

### 🔢 Project 1 – Sorting Methods (`Project1`)
A collection of fundamental sorting algorithm implementations, including:

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

This project showcases an understanding of algorithmic complexity and performance trade-offs between sorting techniques.

---

### 🌳 Search Trees (`SearchTrees`)
Implementations of various tree-based data structures:

- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Red-Black Trees

Includes insertion, deletion, traversal, and balancing logic, illustrating efficient data organization and retrieval strategies.

---

### 🧭 Project 3 – Pathfinding and Graph Algorithms (`CS315Project3`)
Algorithms for working with graphs, including:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

This project demonstrates graph traversal, shortest path computation, and heuristic-based search.

### 🃏 Project 2 – Five Card Poker Game (`Project2.zip`)
A terminal-based poker game simulating five-card draw. Features:

- Deck shuffling and dealing
- Hand evaluation (e.g., flushes, straights, full houses)
- Player-vs-player round logic
- Object-oriented design (Card, Deck, Player classes)

This project applies basic game logic and C++ class structures for simulation.
