Pathfinding and Graph Algorithms

Overview
This project implements a graph representation of Middle Earth using vertices and edges. It provides functionality to perform various graph algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, and Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree.

Features
Reads vertices and edges from text files.
Constructs a graph based on the provided vertices and edges.
Implements BFS to find the shortest path between two vertices.
Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source to a destination.
Implements Prim's algorithm to generate a minimum spanning tree.

Files
main.cpp: Contains the main program logic and implementation of graph algorithms.
MiddleEarthVertices.txt: A text file containing the vertices (locations in Middle Earth).
MiddleEarthEdges.txt: A text file containing the edges (connections between locations) and their weights.

Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the main.cpp file using a C++ compiler
3. Run the executable
4. The program will read data from the provided text files and output the graph, the shortest paths, and the minimum spanning tree.
